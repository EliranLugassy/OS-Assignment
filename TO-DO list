Client:
    parameters: R, fileName
        R = natural number, the query's would be from 1 to R.
        fileName = file with the prob. of numbers 1-R
        
Server:
    the server gets X query: if there is a free S-Thread (ready to work) it will get this X to search.
                             else this X will entrance to the Queue
    ThreadPoolManager - manage the S-Thread's, determine if there is one to search the current X
    S-Thread - (if its free) its getting the X and do:
                                              1) search at the cache if its in there. if it found this X it will send the answer to client.
                                                 ** 
                                              2) 


Querys:
    querys runs in a unlimited-loop, each time getting X by random prob. and sending X to the server through the socket.
          before sending it prints: client<Name>:sending X 
          and wait for the server response. when the server answer is come print it, and back to the loop...

DB:
    the DB save the querys by the form: X Y Z 
                                 while; X-the query, Y-the server answer, Z-the counter of this specific X query (relevant to the Cache).
